# Lua Reference

The Lua scripting API is in early development.

Expect many more things to be supported in the future.

## How to install Lua mods
Lua scripts you make can be placed either the `mods` folder in the base directory, or in `<SAVE FILE LOCATION>/mods`

<br />

## Tips
- When developing Lua mods, run the game from a console. Lua errors and logs will appear there.
- You can use the `print()` command when debugging. Your logs will show up in the console.
